# silly_dungeon
A simple program using while loops to get user input and guide the user through a "mud" style game. 
The purpose of this program is to help me, and maybe others, learn to program, specifically using loops and if statements. 
At this time, I have not gotten to use classes yet, but will in my next project so I can document my learning as I go (and also force me to create more programs for more practice).

# silly_dungeon
A simple program using while loops to get user input and guide the user through a "mud" style game. 
The purpose of this program is to help me, and maybe others, learn to program, specifically using loops and if statements. 
I have since learned to use classes to clean up the code, as well as to make it easier to expand the game.
